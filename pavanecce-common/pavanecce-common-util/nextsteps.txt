FNB:

Collection Properties: declare two fields xxx and xxxImpl. No setter, lazy initialise both fields
Implement minimum collection contract in Javascript and Python - 
  add, addAll, remove, removeAll,contains, set with uniqueness, list with sequence
But first implement the generation of TwoWaySets
   

We want to get to the ValueNetwork use case as soon as possible:
As a User I would like to select an initiating Activity and start it so that I can follow it in my outbox
1. Generate Java code from vdml.uml and myuml.uml
2. Instantiate VDML and my own UMl elements (need to think about working together and reusing the code generation: Classes and Properties)
3. Generate code from UML and VDML elements
4. Initiate activity
5. Store link from ActivityInstance to activity


As a User I would like to select an Activity instance from my inbox and complete it
On deliverable flows, the source Activity is not "Complete" until the receiver accepts the deliverable- allow for reworkk, The accepting Activity cannot start until an evaluation is given of the input deliverables 

Implement file generator for Javascript and Python

DBReverse
When reversing properties into UML TODO check nullability/requirement for readOnly
When reversing Database columns, create different uml.DataType for every configuration per column using constraints- see if you can identify enums
When a PK is a FK, assume inheritance
When a FK is unique, assume oneToOne
Implement associationTables




org.opaeum.reverse.java.ClassifierFactory.getPackageFor(SourceClass, Namespace) needs work, make this more intelligent. Create profile and model resources, generate unique name using non-organization part of qualified name
org.opaeum.eclipse.reverse.db.UmlGenerator.isIdColumn(PersistentTable, Column) should return false for non-numbers - need number ids I think???
In AbstractReverseEngineerAction, the dialog, support uml files to be opened
org.opaeum.reverse.java.ClassifierFactory.createClassifier(SourceClass), 
   when none of the isXXXType methods return true, it is usually java or similar library type that will always be "mapped" rather than generated. 
   Think of a special type for that one.
   On reverse-engineering from Java, specify which packages should simply map to the generated types, and which types are to be generated from the model in future
   Maybe each creation in the method should use that to apply mappedImplementationType
   "mappedImplementationType" should be a collection of Language:mappedType mappings
   
On reverseEngineering from Java, support template bindings
On reverseEngineering from Java, do checks for Sets for uniques and (INDEXED arrayLists) for ordered (simply annotate sorted dudes)
On reverseEngineering from Java, remember Constructors
On reverseEngineering from Java, remember Fields
Update reverse engineering from JDT to be in line with Reflection, especially for creating properties

Forward engineer Java code, create an extremely simple attribute implementor 
If any javax.persistence annotation is present, skip hibernate and jpa annotators, generated BodyCondition methodBodies for Java (support Javascript and Python??)
For twoWay collections, generate a special collection for qualified relationships - the formating of parameters into a key can be standard - it is not for human consumption
The getter for a qualified property must return a collection for OCL
The getter and setter for hibernate needs to be the underlying PersistentCollection - 
    populate the map dynamically from generated qualifier-concatenation code. 
    Remember that qualifiers belonging to the Association will generate an association class carrying all the qualified properties.
    Don't worry about being standard Java here, because multi-qualified relationships don't exist in Java
    Non-standard "SimpleTypes" can be stringified with Strategies
    StructuredDataTypes should generate stringification in a standard interface method 

Lists can't work like qualified relationships because the index is stored in the database only. This is OK.
OCL: Implement STdlLib collection operations in Java/Python/Javascript and extend it
Code metamodel:
Collection statements (mostly take zero or 1 parameter expression)
New statements


Neo4j

JPA:
Other datatypes like CLOBS, BLOBS, BITS
ManyToManies
Lists
AssociationClasses
Maps
