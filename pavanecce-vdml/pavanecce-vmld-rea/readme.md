This project will provide extensions to CMMN that would facilitate online collaborations that extend beyond organizational boundaries. Some planned features are

# 1. For Planned tasks, a built-in workflow that allows

- The initiator of a Task to request confirmation from the actual owner of a task that the planned state of the task is acceptable.

- The actual owner of a task to Confirm or Reject the state of the task.

- The initator of a Task to commit to the terms specified by the planned task's input parameters.

- Calculating the value of the monetary value that will change hands after completion of a task based on these commitments.


# 2. Extensions to the Planning activities

- Creating Sentries, OnParts and Conditions 'on the fly'

- Retrieving performance information regarding potential owners of a task to select the appropriate actual owner

- Creating a planned task, and initiating the confirmation workflow based on an existing entity/document and the owner offering it.


# 3. Intration with Google Calendar and Google Tasks
