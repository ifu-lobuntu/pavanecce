At this point this project only contains some initial code to read OWL files.
The idea is that this project will import OWL ontologies into UML models
We will eventually implement the SourceXXX API that we used for Java reverse engineering.
Question: Any ideas what the use case would be for this? Forward engineering would seem more useful.
