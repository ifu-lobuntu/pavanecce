Javascript:
Implement minimum collection contract 
Implement the generation of TwoWaySets
Implement rest servlet that can support backbone code
Collection Properties: declare two fields xxx which is the collection contract and xxxImpl which is the array. 
 No setter, lazy initialise both fields
Lazy load collections or proxies using REST

Multiple Inheritance
getOwner() with multiple ownerships
Persistence of primitives and enums
