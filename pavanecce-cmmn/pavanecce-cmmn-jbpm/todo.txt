Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Throwing Human Task FAULT events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task COMPLETE events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task SUSPEND events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task RESUME events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task TERMINATE events from TaskService

To test
All the above events but for exit criteria

Todo
ParameterMapping
Timer Event
User Event
Milestone


Throwing Human Task EXIT events from TaskService - happens when exit criteria are achieved
Throwing Human Task CREATE,DISABLE,ENABLE,REENABLE events from TaskService - this is tricky because the task node instance does not exist in jBPM
Scoping of subscriptions
Make recursive subscriptions parameterizable

Process/Case Task
Planning
Planning with quotes for subsequent activities
milestone with cost breakdwon


Throwing Process/Case Task COMPLETE event
Throwing Process/Case Task CREATE event
Stage SUSPEND
Throwing casePlanModel CLOSE event
CLOSED state and event

Assigning tasks at runtime

Autocompletion

Stage exit and event

Difficult
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager
