Throwing UPDATE events from JCR
Throwing UPDATE events from Hibernate
Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Throwing Human Task FAULT events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task COMPLETE events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task SUSPEND events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task RESUME events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task TERMINATE events from TaskService
Manually scoped event subscriptions
Scoping of subscriptions in JCR
Scoping of subscriptions in Hibernate
Implement OCLProcessDialect that extends JavaProcessDialect
  focus on ReturnValueBuilder first, then the others
  consider reversing Java classes to UML
Output ParameterMapping, bindingRefinement and scoped subscriptions
Make recursive subscriptions parameterizable
Timer Event
Milestone
CaseTask

2. To test
UserEvent
exit criteria for human task
Sentry.Conditions


3. To implement

ItemControl.repetitionRule
ItemControl.automaticActivationRule

Process/Case Task
 - parameterMapping
 - transformation

CaseModel:
 - direct exit Criteria
 - manual completion
 - throwing CLOSE, COMPLETE,CREATE,...
 - auto completion, use ItemControl.requiredRule
 
Stage:
 - stagePlanItem's exit and its event
 - manual completion
 - implement and throw CLOSE, COMPLETE,CREATE,SUSPEND,RESUME,TERMINATE...
 - auto completion, use ItemControl.requiredRule

Human Task
 - throwing EXIT events - happens when exit criteria are achieved
 - 
Planning Tables:
 - Planning Table object (string/xml representing the current state of tasks and assignments of roles/parameters)
 - Marshal this from/to the workItem
 - DiscretionaryItem
 - ApplicabilityRule
 - Assigning tasks at runtime
 - Assigning caseParameters at runtime

plan fragment
Transformations on parameterMappings

4. Difficult
Throwing Human Task CREATE,DISABLE,ENABLE,REENABLE events from TaskService - this is tricky because the task node instance does not exist in jBPM
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager

5. Planned Extensions
Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks - REFERENCE to casefileitem. Make sure Jahia will create it in the correct way
Planning with quotes/costing for subsequent activities
milestone with cost breakdown
Support for more time formats
In expressions inside a Task, make the CaseParameters available. This would help with automatic selection of other parameters based on one input parameter

6.Refactoring:
Clear up confusion between org.pavanecce.cmmn.jbpm.flow.builder.AbstractCaseElementHandler and org.pavanecce.cmmn.jbpm.flow.builder.AbstractPlanModelElementHandler


7. Questions for OMG:
When a Stage needs to be closed manually, which users should be allowed to do that? Same goes for suspend/resume/terminate etc.
In the notation examples, it seems there are Discretionary items that also have entryCriteratia. How so?
Discrepancies in XSD:
  In the XSD, TimerEventListener.timerExpression is a fully fledged expression, but in the spec it is just string. Does the result still have to be ISO-8601 compliant?
