Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Throwing Human Task FAULT events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task COMPLETE events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task SUSPEND events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task RESUME events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task TERMINATE events from TaskService

To test
All the above events but for exit criteria
Sentry.Conditions

Todo
Input ParameterMapping and bindingRefinement
  Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks - REFERENCE to casefileitem
  Make sure Jahia will create it in the correct way
Implement OCLProcessDialect that extends JavaProcessDialect
  focus on ReturnValueBuilder first, then the others
  consider reversing Java classes to UML
Output ParameterMapping, bindingRefinement and scoped subscriptions
Timer Event
User Event
Milestone
Process/Case Task
ItemControl.repetitionRule
ItemControl.requiredRule


Throwing Human Task EXIT events from TaskService - happens when exit criteria are achieved
Throwing Human Task CREATE,DISABLE,ENABLE,REENABLE events from TaskService - this is tricky because the task node instance does not exist in jBPM
Scoping of subscriptions
Make recursive subscriptions parameterizable

Planning
Planning with quotes for subsequent activities
milestone with cost breakdwon


Throwing Process/Case Task COMPLETE event
Throwing Process/Case Task CREATE event
Stage SUSPEND
Throwing casePlanModel CLOSE event
CLOSED state and event
ItemControl.automaticActivationRule
DiscretionaryItem
ApplicabilityRule
Assigning tasks at runtime
casePlanModel exit criteria
Autocompletion
plan fragment
Stage exit and event


Difficult
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager
