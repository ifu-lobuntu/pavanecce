Todo
Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
ParameterMapping
Timer Event
User Event
Milestone
Process/Case Task
Planning
Planning with quotes for subsequent activities
milestone with cost breakdwon


Throwing Process/Case Task COMPLETE event
Throwing Process/Case Task CREATE event

Difficult
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager
