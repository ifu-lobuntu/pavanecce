Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Throwing Human Task FAULT events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task COMPLETE events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task SUSPEND events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task RESUME events from TaskService
Throwing Human Task TERMINATE events from TaskService
Manually scoped event subscriptions
Scoping of subscriptions in JCR
Scoping of subscriptions in Hibernate
Implement OCLProcessDialect that extends JavaProcessDialect
  focus on ReturnValueBuilder first, then the others
  consider reversing Java classes to UML
Output ParameterMapping, bindingRefinement and scoped subscriptions
Make recursive subscriptions parameterizable
Timer Event

To test
UserEvent
exit criteria for human task
Sentry.Conditions


Todo
Exits criteria of the various plan Items
Milestone
Process/Case Task
ItemControl.repetitionRule
ItemControl.requiredRule
ItemControl.automaticActivationRule
Throwing Process/Case Task COMPLETE event
Throwing Process/Case Task CREATE event
Stage SUSPEND
Autocompletion
Stage exit and event
Throwing Human Task EXIT events from TaskService - happens when exit criteria are achieved



Input ParameterMapping and bindingRefinement
  Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks - REFERENCE to casefileitem
  Make sure Jahia will create it in the correct way
Support for more time formats



Throwing casePlanModel CLOSE event
CLOSED state and event
DiscretionaryItem
ApplicabilityRule
Assigning tasks at runtime
casePlanModel exit criteria
plan fragment


Difficult
Throwing Human Task CREATE,DISABLE,ENABLE,REENABLE events from TaskService - this is tricky because the task node instance does not exist in jBPM
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager

Ifu Extension
Planning with quotes for subsequent activities
milestone with cost breakdown



Refactoring:
Clear up confustion between org.pavanecce.cmmn.jbpm.flow.builder.AbstractCaseElementHandler and org.pavanecce.cmmn.jbpm.flow.builder.AbstractPlanModelElementHandler
