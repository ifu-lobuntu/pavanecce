BindingRef for input parameters to Cases - how long is that subscrciption valid?
Discrepancies in XSD:
  - In the XSD, TimerEventListener.timerExpression is a fully fledged expression, but in the spec it is just string. Does the result of this expression still have to be a ISO-8601 compliant string, or could it be a date/duration/etc. ?
  - The XSD does not have AuthorizedRoleRefs for user events.
  - The parentTerminate StandardEvent is absent from the XSD

For an instance of the Stage representing the casePlanModel of a Case:
  - does table 7.9 pertain to the Stage instance representing the casePlanModel as well
  - which transition is called when its exitCriteria become true - it does not seem to be in the statemachine. Table 7.5. does state that it will end up in the Terminated state, but table 7.6. does not say how.
  - when this stage instance follows the re-activate transition, what is the effect on the child planItemInstances? This is not covered in table 7.9.

There is a bit of ambiguity in my head around the lifecycle of a Stage/CaseTask/HumanTask/Process task
  - it starts off in the available state
  - when the entryCriteria become true, the repetitionRule is evaluated, and a new instance may be created.
  - as I understand it, if the repitionRule is false, the current instance will progress normally through the lifecycle until completion
  - however, given a repetitionRule=true, does this mean we create a new instance which progresses normally through the lifecycle, depending on manual activation, either from the Enabled or the Active state,
      while the old instance remains in the Available state "under the covers" so to speak, to await the entryCriteria?

If there are multiple instances of a PlanItem, and the exitCriterion occurs, do we exit all of the instances?
When a Stage needs to be completed manually, which users should be allowed to do that? Same goes for suspend/resume/terminate/close etc.
Can a UserEvent occur more than once?
ApplicabilityRules: AND or OR?
