Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Implement OCLProcessDialect that extends JavaProcessDialect
Output ParameterMapping, bindingRefinement and scoped subscriptions
Recursive subscriptions, parameterizable


2. To test
Sentry.Conditions
Sentries with multiple onParts
*.no sentry
*.repetitionRule
*.parentSuspend
*.parentResume
Storage of event variables inside StageInstances
CaseTask.reactivated - check that process is restarted - it failed previously

3. To implement
Write Output Parameters from Processes to Tasks (CaseTask, ProcessTask, Standalone Case) 
Write Output parameters from Tasks to the containing case's caseFileItem (kind of superfluous in a pass by reference world).
Resolve cleverly which user should own system-initiated tasks
Clear up the distinction between WS-Ready, WS-Reserved and WS-InProgress and how they relate to Active and Enabled

Planning Service:

 - Prepare planning perspective on PlanItemInstanceContainer
   - wrap existing tasks in planned tasks
   - include a list of discretionaryItemIds AND their planITemDefinition's name
 - Prepare new discretionary item
 - Submit plan
Planning Tables:
 - Planning Table object (string/xml representing the potential task types) issue the create through processInstance.signalEvent so that the process can assign params/roles
 - DiscretionaryItem
 - DiscretionaryItem.itemControl.requiredRule
 - ApplicabilityRule
 
Planning Command:
 - Assigning tasks at runtime (use forward/delegate)
 - Assigning caseParameters at runtime (use command)
 - think of costing and acceptance thereof here

Process/Case Task
 - parameter transformation

CaseModel:
 - REACTIVATE (from Failed,Terminated, Completed? need input from OMG)*
 

plan fragment
contextRefs for rules

4. Difficult
Sentry.condition without onParts - when to trigger the evaluation of the condition.
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager


5. Questions for OMG:
Which transition is called when a CasePlanModel stage reaches its exitCriteria - it does not seem to be in the statemachine.
When a Stage needs to be completed manually, which users should be allowed to do that? Same goes for suspend/resume/terminate/close etc.
In the notation examples, it seems there are Discretionary items that also have entryCriteratia. How so?
For stages and tasks, when they are enabled and repetitionRule=true, it should create a new instance, but what happens to the instance that was already in the available state?
Cab a UserEvent occur more than once?
7.5.3. does not include Timer/UserEvents in the discussion of RequiredRules, however 5.4.11.2 does, but again it is excluded in table 42. 
Table 49 does not list the exit transition for CaseInstances - which transition will occur when the Case's casePlanModel Stage reaches its exitCriteria? 
Does table 52 pertain to the Stage instance representing the casePlanModel as well? If so, what do we do with the re-active transition propagation to subelements?
Discrepancies in XSD:
  In the XSD, TimerEventListener.timerExpression is a fully fledged expression, but in the spec it is just string. Does the result still have to be ISO-8601 compliant?
  AuthorizedRoleRefs for user events?
  parentTerminate StandardEvent absent
