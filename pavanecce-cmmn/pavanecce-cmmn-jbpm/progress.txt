Generate OCM and JPA test Java classes from UML along with CaseFileItemDefinition includes
Implement OCLProcessDialect that extends JavaProcessDialect
Output ParameterMapping, bindingRefinement and scoped subscriptions
Recursive subscriptions, parameterizable


2. To test more directly
Sentry.Conditions
Sentries with multiple onParts
*.no sentry
*.repetitionRule
*.parentSuspend
*.parentResume
Storage of event variables inside StageInstances
CaseTask.reactivated - check that process is restarted - it failed previously

3. To implement
Planning Service
 - startPlanning (include current parameters, applicabilityRule, authorizedRole)
 - prepareDiscretionaryItem 
   - recheck applicabilityRule
   - recheck authorizedRole
 - submitPlan 
   - update parameters (taskContent AND workItem ),
   - role (do role-assignment in process too) and 
   - status/transition, 
   - (due date?)

TimerEventListener.timerStart CaseFileItem
TimerEventListener.timerStart PlanItem

Write Output Parameters from Processes to Task.result (CaseTask, ProcessTask, Standalone Case) 

Role management
 - Resolve cleverly which user should own system-initiated tasks 
 - Store roleAssignment in process 
   - do it as variables with set values 
   - would be serialization friendly
   - use this for automatic assignment
   - could be used to authorize but remember  people could have the required role elsewhere
 - Validate authorization for planning - get it from the UserInfo service

Planning Tables:
 - DiscretionaryItem.entryCriteria
 - DiscretionaryItem.exitCriteria
 - DiscretionaryItem.itemControl.requiredRule
 - ApplicabilityRule

Process/Case Task
 - parameter transformation

CaseModel:
 - REACTIVATE (from Failed,Terminated, Completed? need input from OMG)*

4. Current potential problems 
AbstractPersistentSubscriptionManager
 - Find a way to resolve the correct InternalKnowledgeRuntime from  somewhere
 - Find a way to get to the commandScopedEntity manager - the reflection won't work in CDI 

PlanningService (look at TaskServiceFactory interface)
 - find a way to get to the persistence context - the reflection won't work in CDI
 - find a way to get to the InternalTaskService

5. Difficult
Sentry.condition without onParts - when to trigger the evaluation of the condition.
With JCR Property.CHANGE events, try to get the original value and only fire events for ADD_/REMOVE_REFERENCE when they applicable - JCR limitation
Optimize caching of SubscriptionInfo and perhaps even other OCM objects IN OCMSubscriptioinManager

6 Low priority
Plan fragments 
 - For Plan Items
 - For Discretionary Items
 
ContextRefs for rules
Internationalization
Write Output parameters from Tasks to the containing case's caseFileItem (kind of superfluous in a pass by reference world).
