To implement
Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks - REFERENCE to casefileitem. Make sure Jahia will create it in the correct way
Planning with quotes/costing for subsequent activities
 - add a "want parameter"
   - publish wants somewhere against the case planning user
 - add a "quote/offer parameter"
   - quotes must have a standardized link to the originating user and the task instance
   - multiple quotes should be linked
   - only one quote is selected, and with it the user it came from
   - generate this quote/link as part of the CND file for Jahia
   - put an expression somewhere in the metainfo that calculates the value in currency in terms of the "want parameter"
 - add a "correlation key" parameter
   - for use in VDML
   - used to identify tasks
   - In expressions inside a Task, make this CaseParameter available. This would help with automatic selection of other parameters based on one input parameter
   - once a user has selected the correlation parameter, have a mechanism to calculate values for the other parameters after planning 
 - introduce state extensions (substates) for planningTableContainers:
   - awaiting confirmation - after submit plan by case owner
   - confirmed - after all items confirmed by actors
   - committed - after all items confirmed by actors and plan owner accepts
 - introduce state extensions for planItems and discretionaryItems:
   - awaiting confirmation
   - confirmed
   - committed inputs and actor cannot change
   
 - milestone with cost breakdown
   - introduce payment service
   - issue payment automatically when milestone achieved
   - an further refinement could even freeze funds on commitment
   - issue data to VDML db for tasks whose completion are entry criteria
 
Reversing Java classes to UML for OCL expressions
Allowing SentryInstances and OnPartInstances to be created at runtime
e-mail listener that creates tasks
allow user to associate the task with a case type and start the case
