1. Implementation of an appropriate JBPM6WorkflowProvider that also supports CMMN
2. Automatic generation of the necessary Spring deployment descriptors
3. Automatic generation of JCR structure representating of Tasks (cnd files)
4. Some extensions to the MyDashboard user interface to support advanced CMMN features.
