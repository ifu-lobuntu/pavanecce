To implement ASAP:
Extend the jBPM6WorkflowProvider
Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks to store parameters.
Allow OCM objects as values for Parameters, and interpret them correctly when building up the JCR task
Parameters will be either "wants" or "offers" - publish them accordingly against the wanting/offering user
Generate the mod-xxxworkflow.xml spring descriptor
Generate permissions for tasks based on Role

jBPM on JCR
(The following ideas could allow deeper integration between Jahia/jBPM, but the current Jahia workflow subsystem is a bit of an obstacle for
this type of integration. However, these ideas would allow content in Tasks to be represented more directly in Jahia, and we may want to bypass a substantial 
part of the  existing Jahia workflow subsystem in the process.) 
Implement TaskService on OCM/JCR
Store planning model in OCM as well
Create tasks directly under the user and make sure Jahia will interpret it in the correct way
Provide standard templates for tasklists, planning tables, etc.
