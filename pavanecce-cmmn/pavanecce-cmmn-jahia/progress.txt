To implement ASAP:
Extend the jBPM6WorkflowProvider
Generate JCR node types (CND) for tasks to store parameters.
Allow OCM objects as values for Parameters, and interpret them correctly when building up the JCR task
Parameters will be either "wants" or "offers" - publish them accordingly against the wanting/offering user
Generate the mod-xxxworkflow.xml spring descriptor
Generate permissions for tasks based on Role

jBPM on JCR
(this is a lot of work and OCM performance is always a concern, and conflicts with the existing Jahia Workflow subsystem)
Implement TaskService on OCM/JCR 
Store planning model in OCM as well
Create tasks directly under the user and make sure Jahia will interpret it in the correct way
Provide standard templates for tasklists, planning tables, etc.
